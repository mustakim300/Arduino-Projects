##  Gesture Brightness Controller using Arduino

In this project I’m going to make a Gesture/Finger Brightness controller of a LED with the help of media-pipe library . For this will require software and some hardware components and here I’m using C and python because Arduino code is written in C and the sending code that is which is communicating with Arduino is written in Python.
