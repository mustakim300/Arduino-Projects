## Finger Counter using Arduino

In this I have made a finger counter with the help of media-pipe library and finger count will display on the seven-segment LED. For this will require software and some hardware components and here I’m using C and python because Arduino code is written in C and the sending code that is which is communicating with Arduino is written in Python so let’s move further and make this project, below are the list of component and software which you will required in this project. To know more about this project read the full article from [**Here**](https://electrocircuit.net/chrome-dinosaur-game-with-arduino/)
